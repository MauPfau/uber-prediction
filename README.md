Prediction of number of Uber pickups by hour and district in New York City

## _Description_
The project is to predict the amount of Uber pickups will occur in different areas for different times in New York City. <br>
To do so, we create a dataset with features that might impact the number (weather, holyday, event, sports game near stadium, ...) <br>
We train a few models including Neural Network, and Random Forest.
